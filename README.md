# Metamorphic Testing Assignment

## Marks: 92 / 100

## Feedback
### Categories
An excellent set of well-justified categories. Great use of referencing. It's a good idea to probe
the ability to handle edge-cases such as single elements and empty lists. It's good to investigate
the behaviour with / without duplicate elements.

### Test set
An excellent, well-presented set of test cases.

### Metamorphic tests
The metamorphic relations are well thought through, and nicely justified. The slight exception was
for 3.1 - (2), where the transformation was the same as (1), and the equivalence (c) does not make
sense.

### Test implementations
The JUnit test cases faithfully implement the categories and relations. They use utility functions
nicely.

### Random test generator
The random approach nicely tests the function 1000 times with different random inputs. Well done.
