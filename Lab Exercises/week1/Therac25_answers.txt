What was the system?
--------------------

The system in question was Therac-25, a computer-controlled radiation therapy machine. It was used
to accelerate electrons to create high-energy beams that can destroy tumors with minimal impact on
the surrounding healthy tissue. Compared with the older version (Therac-20), Therac-25 is more
compact, versatile, and easier to use.

How did the system fail?
------------------------

Between June 1985 and January 1987, six people were given massive overdoses of radiation by the
Therac-25. Two software faults were to blame. One, when the operator incorrectly selected X-ray mode
before quickly changing to electron mode, which allowed the electron beam to be set for X-ray mode
without the X-ray target being in place. A second fault allowed the electron beam to activate during
field-light mode, during which no beam scanner was active or target was in place.

Had there been any prior warnings?
----------------------------------

Related problems were found in the Therac-20 software, but they were not recognised until after the
Therac-25 accidents because the Therac-20 includes hardware safety interlocks. Thus, no injuries
resulted during the usage of Therac-20 software. This might be the reason why the issues were not
fixed and persisted in the Therac-25 software.

What parts of the system caused the failure?
--------------------------------------------

There were several parts that were responsible for the cause of the accidents. The Therac-25 system
did not have any hardware interlocks to prevent the electron-beam from operating in its high-energy
mode without the target in place. The hardware had no way for the software to verify that the
sensors were working correctly. The engineer had reused software that had defacts from older models.
The software had a flag variable that could cause arithmatic overflow to occur.

How could the failure have been prevented?
-------------------------------------------

The old software should have been tested and revised before reusing it. The engineer should not be
overconfidence with the software and have kept hardware interlocks in the system. The system should
have a more intuitive interface and informative error codes. The engineer should have carried out
investigation when the issue was first reported on older model.
